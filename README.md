# Real-Time

This project implement parts of RTOS

files explainations: 

### SMARTS77.H

the main header file. This file includes Event class, Mutex class, Task class, and Parallelism class.
Parallelism class includes all the tasks of the system and implements the tasks schedule.

### SMARTS77.CPP

SMARTS77.H class body.

### SchedAlgo77.CPP

short-term scheduler algorithms: RoundRobin, EDF, RMS, FPS.

### EXTERN77.CPP
This class implements the external function of SMART system.
#### timerInterruptHandler
This function is interrupt function and called 18.2 times per second ( every ~~ 55 millisec).
#### scheduler
This function is called by hardware called 'timerInterruptHandler' function or by software SMARTS system's functions or by software SMARTS system's functions.
#### myTaskEnd
This function called when task is done.

### EVENT77.CPP
Events handling	

### APP77.CPP
An application to demonstrate SMARTS77  functioning.


## Part 1
Implementation of activating cyclic processes using RMS algorithm.

## Part 2
Implementation of Mutex (Acquire Release ect.).

## Part 3

Solving the Unbounded priority inversion problem by implementing if priority-inheritance
